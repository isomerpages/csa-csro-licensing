Licensee who decides to cease business operations prior to the expiry of their licence should submit a licence cancellation application to CSRO.

Please note that there shall be no refund of licence fees in the event of early licence termination unless there are valid justifications. For such cases, a written request must be submitted separately to <a href="mailto:contact@csro.gov.sg">contact@csro.gov.sg</a>. The email should include the name of the licensee, licence number, and the justifications.
