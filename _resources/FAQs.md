<summary><h5>1. Who needs to apply for cybersecurity service provider's licence?</h5></summary>
	
All providers of managed security operations centre monitoring services and penetration testing services (i.e. licensable cybersecurity services) to the Singapore market will need to apply for a cybersecurity service provider’s licence, regardless of whether they are companies or individuals (i.e. freelancers or sole proprietorships owned and controlled by individuals) or third-party cybersecurity service providers (“CSPs”) that provide these services in support of other CSPs. However, a company that provides licensable cybersecurity services solely for its related company(ies) e.g. in-house service provider, does not require a licence.<b>#</b><br><br>
Resellers, third-party vendors or overseas CSPs including the affiliates of a licensee who provide licensable cybersecurity services to the Singapore market would need to be licensed.<b>*</b><br><br>
<b>#</b>According to the Companies Act, related company(ies) is defined as, but not limited to:
<ol><font size="3.5">a) holding company of another corporation;
<br>b) subsidiary of another corporation; or
<br>c) subsidiary of the holding company of another corporation.</font></ol>

<b>*</b><i>Business entities providing software solution, platform or tool to support other cybersecurity services providers would not be required to be licensed unless these business entities also provide service offerings that include licensable cybersecurity services.</i>

</details>
<details>
<summary><h5>15. What is the format for a Certificate of Clearance?</h5></summary>

<summary><h5>28. Will it be an offence to use unlicensed cybersecurity service providers?</h5></summary>
	
It will not be an offence under the Cybersecurity Act to use unlicensed cybersecurity service providers. However, consumers should be wary of the safety and security risks that unlicensed service providers may pose, given the service providers’ extensive access into their clients’ computer systems when providing their services. Any misuse of such confidential information by the unlicensed service providers may result in severe damages to the consumers.
<br><br>Consumers are therefore encouraged to only procure licensable cybersecurity services from licensed cybersecurity service providers, and to inform CSRO of any service providers providing licensable cybersecurity services without a licence. Person who engages in the business of providing any licensable cybersecurity services to other person without a licence shall be guilty of an offence under Section 24 of the Cybersecurity Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. Under Section 31 of the Cybersecurity Act, unlicensed cybersecurity service providers are also not entitled to bring any proceeding in any court to recover any commission, fee, gain, or reward for the service provided.

<summary><h5>29. What is the difference between CSA and CSRO?</h5></summary>
	
The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) is the agency set up to keep Singapore’s cyberspace safe and secure through the administering of the Cybersecurity Act. To administer the licensing framework, CSA has set up Cybersecurity Services Regulation Office (CSRO) which will act as the point of interface for all licensing related matters. These include enforcing the licensing framework; responding to the industry’s queries and feedback; as well as sharing of resources on licensable cybersecurity services with consumers such as the list of licensees and buyer’s guides.
